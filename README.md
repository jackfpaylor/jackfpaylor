### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Jack and I am a senior at The University of Oklahoma - Norman double majoring in Management Information Systems with a software development concentration, and Energy Management. I am currently working in a data engineering intern position at Lease Analytics LLC where I create full-stack web apps for database and data pipeline management, and maintaining a large amount of oil and gas data stored across multiple environments. On the side I develop iOS apps and are involved in not-for-profit leadership for an organization in my hometown.
