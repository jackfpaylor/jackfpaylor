### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Jack and I am a junior at The University of Oklahoma - Norman double majoring in Management Information Systems with a software development concentration, and Energy Management. I am currently working in a software developer intern position at Lease Analytics LLC where I create full-stack web apps for management and administration, including third party app integration, like Jira. On the side I am currently working on projects that target the energy and public safety industries.
